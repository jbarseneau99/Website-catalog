### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional, technical, and operational requirements for the **Space Data Archive System**, a standalone desktop thick client application designed to discover, extract, process, and archive space-related content from internet sources. The system operates independently on the user's machine, providing a complete solution for managing large-scale catalogs of **200,000 to 500,000 assets** across diverse types (e.g., articles, images, videos, PDFs, datasets). It includes robust mechanisms to identify, classify, and process every asset type for space research applications. While designed as a standalone utility, the system supports optional integration with the **MACH33 research platform** to deliver structured content to MACH33's **Operational Relational Database (ORDB)** when required.

#### 1.2 Scope
The **Space Data Archive System** provides a desktop-native environment to manage the full content acquisition lifecycle: discovery, acquisition, processing, storage, and synchronization. It connects directly to external websites, handles complex extraction and enrichment, and stores structured results locally with optional cloud synchronization. Key features include:
- **Multiple Discovery Strategies**: DOM-based crawling, sitemap parsing, pattern-based URL generation, and API-based enumeration.
- **Asset Type Handling**: Identification, classification, and processing of diverse asset types (e.g., HTML articles, images, videos, PDFs, datasets) within large catalogs.

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The **Space Data Archive System** is a standalone desktop utility that leverages local system resources to manage catalogs of **200,000 to 500,000 assets**, each accessible via URLs pointing to diverse asset types. It operates independently, providing a complete solution for content acquisition, processing, and storage without requiring external platforms. For users opting to integrate with the **MACH33 research platform**, the system supports configurable export of enriched content to the ORDB. The system interfaces directly with external websites, ensuring full control over data acquisition and processing without intermediate servers.

#### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
- **System Operators**: Technical users who configure discovery strategies, manage proxies, and monitor performance for large catalogs. They require tools to classify and process diverse asset types.
- **Analysts**: Non-technical users who review extracted data, trigger ingestion runs, and validate content quality across asset types. They need simplified interfaces for browsing and filtering large catalogs.
- **Developers**: Technical users who create and maintain **Discovery Maps**, define asset type classifiers, and configure optional ORDB exports. They require configuration tools and API access.

#### 2.3 Operating Environment
- **Supported OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 11+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Minimum Hardware**: 4-core CPU, 16GB RAM, **1TB disk space** (to accommodate **200,000–500,000 assets**), stable internet connection
- **Software Dependencies**: Electron v20+, Node.js v16+, MongoDB Atlas client (optional for cloud storage), BrightData SDK, libraries for asset type detection (e.g., `file-type`, `pdf.js`)

#### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The application must operate as a self-contained thick client, with all logic for discovery, acquisition, processing, and enrichment executed locally.
- No intermediate servers, backend APIs, or cloud-based processing may exist between the desktop application and target websites, except for proxy services and optional cloud storage.
- Proxy integration via **BrightData** is mandatory for domains requiring geo-rotation or IP anonymity.
- The technology stack must include **Electron**, **Node.js**, and **React** for local control and cross-platform compatibility.
- The system must support offline-first operation, caching assets locally with optional synchronization to **MongoDB Atlas**.
- **MongoDB Atlas** and **GridFS** are optional for remote storage but required if cloud synchronization is enabled.
- The system must comply with target website terms of service, implementing adaptive rate limiting.
- Integration with MACH33 is optional and must not compromise standalone functionality.

### 3. System Architecture

#### 3.1 Components
The system comprises modular components optimized for high-volume, diverse asset processing as a standalone utility:
- **Electron App Shell**: Provides the UI/UX container for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Node.js Processing Engine**: Executes core logic for discovery, acquisition, processing, and storage, with parallel pipelines for large catalogs.
- **React UI Layer**: Delivers modular interfaces (Dashboard, Discovery Configuration, Storage Management, Asset Type Explorer) with pagination and filtering.
- **Discovery Maps**: Domain-specific configurations defining crawling rules, selectors, and asset type classifiers.
- **Local Storage Manager**: Manages JSON records and media files in structured folders, with deduplication and type-specific handling.
- **MongoDB Atlas Connector**: Optional component for cloud synchronization and large file storage via **GridFS**, optimized for **200,000–500,000 assets**.
- **BrightData Proxy Integration**: Facilitates geo-rotated, anonymous outbound requests with zone management.
- **Asset Type Classifier**: Identifies and categorizes asset types (e.g., article, image, video, PDF, dataset) based on MIME types, file extensions, and content analysis.
- **Export Manager**: Optional component for configuring and executing exports to MACH33's ORDB.

#### 3.2 Data Flow
The system follows a sequential pipeline optimized for diverse asset types:
1. **User Configuration**: The user selects or creates a website configuration via the UI, loading a **Discovery Map** with asset type classifiers.
2. **Discovery**: The **DiscoveryManager** crawls pages, parses sitemaps, or generates URLs, queuing targets with metadata (e.g., priority, depth, suspected asset type).
3. **Acquisition**: The **AcquisitionManager** downloads content, using proxies and rate limiting, and passes assets to the **Asset Type Classifier**.
4. **Processing**: The **ProcessingManager** extracts structured data, enriches it with metadata (e.g., title, tags, asset type), and applies type-specific processing (e.g., OCR for PDFs).
5. **Storage**: The **StorageManager** saves data locally (JSON/media) and optionally synchronizes with **MongoDB Atlas** (structured records, GridFS for large files).
6. **Export (Optional)**: The **Export Manager** pushes structured data to MACH33's ORDB if integration is enabled, with configurable export formats.

#### 3.3 Optional Integration with MACH33
The system supports optional integration with MACH33 via the **Export Manager**, which delivers structured data to the ORDB using a predefined schema (e.g., JSON records with `asset_type` metadata). Integration is disabled by default and can be enabled via UI configuration. The system remains fully functional without MACH33, storing all data locally or in MongoDB Atlas.
