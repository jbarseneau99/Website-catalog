# Troubleshooting UI Rendering Issues in Electron

This document outlines the process we used to diagnose and fix UI rendering issues in the Space Data Archive System Electron application.

## Initial Symptoms
- Electron process was running (visible in Activity Monitor)
- No UI was displayed
- No clear error messages in the logs

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Application Process
```bash
ps aux | grep electron
```
Confirmed the Electron process was running with multiple threads.

### Step 2: Check Application Logs
```bash
tail -n 20 logs/pipeline.log
```
Found no specific errors related to UI rendering.

### Step 3: Inspect HTML Loading
Examined main.js to see which HTML file was being loaded:
- Found it was trying to load index.html
- Had a fallback to simple-ui.html

### Step 4: Test Simplified UI
Modified main.js to directly load simple-ui.html to verify if the issue was with the more complex UI:
```javascript
// Load the simple UI file directly for debugging
const htmlPath = path.join(__dirname, 'ui', 'simple-ui.html');
```

### Step 5: Create a Minimal UI
Created a new basic-ui.html file without React dependencies to eliminate possible causes of the rendering issues.

### Step 6: Update Main Process
Updated main.js to load the new basic-ui.html file with proper error handling.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Conflicting Implementations**
   - Two separate implementations of the Logs tab
   - DOM-based implementation in app-ui.js
   - React-based implementation in app.js

2. **Material UI Component Loading**
   - Issues with loading Material UI components
   - Incorrect dependencies or script loading order

3. **React Rendering Issues**
   - Problems with React hooks and state management
   - Conflicts between different rendering approaches

## Fix Implementation

1. **Created Simplified UI**
   - Implemented a basic-ui.html file using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Replaced React components with native DOM elements
   - Created tab-based interface without React dependencies

2. **Updated Main Process**
   - Modified main.js to load the simplified UI
   - Added better error handling for HTML file loading
   - Improved logging for debugging

3. **Maintained API Compatibility**
   - Kept the same Electron API bridge through preload.js
   - Ensured all functionality remained accessible

## Verification Process

1. Created a restart script (restart.sh) to kill any running instances and start fresh
2. Confirmed the UI now displays properly
3. Tested all functionality to ensure it works as expected
4. Documented the solution for future reference

## Lessons Learned

1. **Framework Complexity**
   - Electron + React + Material UI adds complexity that can lead to rendering issues
   - Consider simpler approaches for desktop applications when appropriate

2. **Debugging Strategy**
   - Start with the simplest possible UI to verify basic functionality
   - Incrementally add complexity to isolate issues

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling in the main process
   - Add detailed logging for UI loading issues

4. **Multiple Implementations**
   - Avoid having multiple implementations of the same feature (DOM vs React)
   - Standardize on a single approach for consistency
