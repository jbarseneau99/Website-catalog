  "content" : "Axiom Space is a private spaceflight company founded in 2016 with headquarters in Houston, Texas. The company's primary focus is to develop and operate commercial space stations in low Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nKey points about Axiom Space:\n\n1. Space station development: Axiom is working on creating the world's first commercial space station, which will initially be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) before becoming a standalone orbiting platform.\n\n2. Axiom Station: The planned space station will consist of multiple modules, including habitation, research, and manufacturing facilities. It is designed to support a variety of commercial, scientific, and tourism activities.\n\n3. NASA partnership: In 2020, NASA selected Axiom Space to build a commercial module to be attached to the ISS. This module will serve as the foundation for the future Axiom Station.\n\n4. Private astronaut missions: Axiom Space has plans to conduct private astronaut missions to the ISS, offering individuals the opportunity to experience spaceflight and conduct research in microgravity.\n\n5. Experienced leadership: The company was founded by Michael Suffredini, former NASA ISS program manager, and Kam Ghaffarian, an entrepreneur with experience in the space industry.\n\nAxiom Space aims to advance commercial spaceflight and create new opportunities for research, manufacturing, and space tourism in low Earth orbit, while also serving as a potential replacement for the ISS when it is eventually decommissioned.",
